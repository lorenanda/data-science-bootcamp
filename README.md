# Data Science Bootcamp
I am currently enrolled in a 12-week full-time Data Science Bootcamp at Spiced Academy in Berlin. Here are the projects I complete each week:

1. [Animation of a scatterplot of world fertility rate and life expectancy.](https://github.com/lorenanda/animated-scatterplot)
2. [Classification of passenger survival on the Titanic.](https://github.com/lorenanda/titanic)
